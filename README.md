# blockchainworkshop

This repo is with regards to workshop done at RAIT (Navi Mumbai). Will keep updating this with more resources, references and steps to use while running the projects.

It contains 3 DApp projects-
1. Voting using geth-client for ethereum
2. Voting using truffle framework and ganache-cli
3. Voting with token on truffle and ganache-cli

Warning: The dapps have been designed to give basic overview of how to code a smart contract, deploy it to blockchain and use the smart contract functions from front-end. There are several security considerations which need to be taken care of if such Dapps are to be developed for production scale projects. Please go through all '.md' files which have been added so far and will be added to get complete overview while implementing. Also take care of the versions of different eth-clients and libraries involved while developing the project on your own.
